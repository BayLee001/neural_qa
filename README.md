Source code for "Neural Multi-Step Reasoning for Question Answering on Semi-Structured Tables"

# Instructions to generate Training and Test Data
1) Get code from Compositional Semantic Parsing on Semi-Structured Tables (ACL 2015) (https://worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/0xf26cd79d4d734287868923ad1067cf4c/)
2) Overwrite code from 1) with code from src_neural
3) Run code according to instructions from 1), during run files starting with "translated_" will be created, they will contain the training and test data.
